# Objective:

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a patient has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

# Data:

The dataset used for this project is derived from the Cleveland Database from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes various clinical parameters such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate, exercise-induced angina, ST depression, slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels, and thallium stress result.
There is also a version of it available on Kaggle.Â https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumaiyatasmeem/heart-disease-classification-dataset

# Methodology:

Data Exploration: The dataset will be thoroughly explored to understand the distribution of features, identify potential correlations, and handle missing values or outliers.
Feature Engineering: Relevant features will be extracted or created to improve model performance.
Model Selection and Training: Various machine learning algorithms will be tested and compared to select the best-performing model for heart disease prediction.
Model Evaluation: The chosen model will be evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Evaluation:

The project aims to achieve a prediction accuracy of 95% or higher.

# Potential Impact:

A successful model could assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk of heart disease, enabling early intervention and improved patient outcomes.

Note: This is a preliminary summary. The final summary will be refined based on the project's outcomes and insights.

# Additional Information:
